# CSS Background Color Issue with Transparency
This repository demonstrates a common issue in CSS where setting a semi-transparent background color doesn't produce the expected visual result due to the interaction with parent element backgrounds and the cascading nature of CSS styles.  The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` offers several solutions.

## Problem
The issue arises when a semi-transparent background color is applied to an element, but its parent or another ancestor element has a background color that interacts with the semi-transparency. The semi-transparent color will blend with the parent element's background, resulting in an unexpected visual outcome.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.css` file offers the following approaches to solve the problem:

1. **Using `background-color` with a fully opaque color:** Avoid using semi-transparent colors to prevent blending with parent backgrounds.
2. **Applying `background-color` to the parent:** Set the desired background color on the parent and then use a different color that contrasts on the child element. 
3. **Specifying a higher z-index:** If the layering is an issue, use z-index to properly position the element and make sure the intended color applies correctly. 
4. **Using absolute positioning:** Position the element absolutely so it does not interact with its parent's background.
